This is the final project of the JavaScript Introduction course. The aim was to create a website with graduates of the school for the possibility of their future recruitment for internships or jobs by employers. The important thing was to add a form that would add a new graduate card to the "employer portal". This has been successfully implemented, the new card is saved in the browser memory and loaded on subsequent visits to the page. Almost all pages are adapted to different types of devices, as far as it was possible at the initial level :)
